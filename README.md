## 🚀 Product Idea
**Arjuna** is an intelligent compliance assistant designed specifically for Indian shopkeepers and traders. It bridges the gap between complex tax laws and the shop floor by providing instant, simplified, and actionable legal advice through a platform they already use: **WhatsApp**.

### The Problem
- **Confusion:** 90% of shopkeepers are confused by GST notices and legal jargon.
- **Fear:** The average fine for simple delays is ₹10,000+.
- **Lack of Access:** Legal help is often expensive and inaccessible for micro-businesses.
- **Language Barrier:** Most official notices are in English, while many traders prefer Hindi.

### The Solution
Arjuna allows users to:
1.  **Snap a Photo:** Take a picture of any GST notice.
2.  **Get AI Analysis:** Receive an instant breakdown of what the notice means.
3.  **Hear it in Hindi:** Listen to a generated voice explanation in simple language.
4.  **Reply Instantly:** Get a professionally drafted reply letter in seconds.
